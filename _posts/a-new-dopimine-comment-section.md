We’ve developed a reflex. Before we even finish reading a post, our thumb is already hovering over the comment icon.

The comment section used to be for feedback. Now, it’s becoming a **"distraction engine"** fueled by three very human—but very exhausting—urges:

### 1. The Dopamine Hit
That rush of checking how many "likes" our own witty reply got. We aren't engaging with the author; we’re chasing our own notification high.

### 2. The Validation Loop
Using someone else’s platform to seek a "YEP" or "Exactly!" from strangers to feel seen.

### 3. The Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)
Feeling like the real party is in the thread, leading us to skim the actual content just to join the "conversation" faster.

> The result? The actual insight, the nuance, and the hard work of the creator become secondary. We’re treating deep thoughts like mere "headers" for the social chaos below.

It’s powerful because it connects us, but it’s disturbing because it fragments our attention. We’re losing the ability to just consume and reflect without needing to immediately react.
